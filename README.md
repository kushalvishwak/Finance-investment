This give the Brief about the how to analysis Multiple stock in single Portfolios 

How to analysis the market and calculate the risk in the Portfolio.

Here I took 5 stock in the single Portfolio

i calculate the risk and up's and down's of market 

By keeping in mind there is a proverb " Don't Put All your Eggs in One Basket". 
This is a piece of advice which means that one should not concentrate all efforts and resources in one area as one could lose everything.   

That why i took 5 stock, if any one or two goes down, there are other stock that recover the Margin.

Market is always Volatile, risk is always there but we have to find a way where risk is there but the return will be more than the expectation.


#### Beta Calculation 

The beta indicates how volatile a stock's price is in comparison to stocks in general.
A beta greater than 1 indicates a stock's price swings more wildly than most stocks.
A beta of 1 or lower indicates that a stock's price is steadier than most stocks

### CAPM
The CAPM formula is widely used in the finance industry. It is vital in calculating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC),
as CAPM computes the cost of equity.

WACC is used extensively in financial modeling.  It can be used to find the net present value (NPV) of the future cash flows of an investment and to further calculate its enterprise value and finally its equity value.

CAPM Example – Calculation of Expected Return
Let’s calculate the expected return on a stock, using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula. Suppose the following information about a stock is known:

It trades on the NYSE and its operations are based in the United States
Current yield on a U.S. 10-year treasury is 2.5%
The average excess historical annual return for U.S. stocks is 7.5%
The beta of the stock is 1.25 (meaning its average return is 1.25x as volatile as the S&P500 over the last 2 years)
What is the expected return of the security using the CAPM formula?

Let’s break down the answer using the formula from above in the article:

Expected return = Risk Free Rate + [Beta x Market Return Premium]
Expected return = 2.5% + [1.25 x 7.5%]
Expected return = 11.9%

### calculation of sharpe ratio

The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return. 
It describes how much excess return you receive for the volatility of holding a riskier
